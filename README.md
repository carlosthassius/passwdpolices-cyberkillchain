# Password Analysis and Vulnerability Exploitation in Windows Systems

This study addresses two crucial aspects of digital security: password analysis and the exploitation of vulnerabilities in Windows systems. The work investigated the cracking of passwords for PDF files using the John the Ripper tool, evaluating the time required for cracking based on parameters such as size, alphabet type, and other factors.

Additionally, zxcvbn was used to estimate password strength and project scenarios that hinder cracking. In parallel, a Windows machine was infiltrated using Metasploit and the SMBv1 protocol with the EternalBlue exploit, aiming to transfer ransomware and encrypt a directory.

The results showed that simple and predictable passwords are easily cracked, while complex passwords with greater character diversity offer more resistance to attacks. The exploitation of the SMBv1 protocol highlighted the impact of outdated systems, demonstrating how attacks can evolve into malware execution. The study also emphasized the importance of using firewalls to protect against such intrusions.

This work underscores the importance of robust security policies, frequent updates, and awareness of best protection practices.
